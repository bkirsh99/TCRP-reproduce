## *Full Reproducibility of Computational Research: Myth or Reality?* 

The goal of this project is to replicate the study [Few-shot learning creates predictive models of drug response that translate from high-throughput screens to individual patients (*Nat Cancer* 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-020-00169-2#data-availability), which describes a transfer learning algorithm for drug response predictions in cancer.

The authors' original codebase can be accessed [here](https://github.com/idekerlab/TCRP/) and the refactored codebase can be accessed [here](https://github.com/shfong/tcrp-reproduce).

This codebase consists of instructions, data, and code for reproducing **challenges 1** of the original study (transfer of CRISPR and drug response models for prediction in the context of a new tissue).
